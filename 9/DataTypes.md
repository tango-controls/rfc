## Tango Data Types Specification

Data Types are specifying format and limits of pieces of information exchanged between Tango Controls components.   

### Goals

Data Types specification aims to standardise a way how different kind of information is entered, displayed and processed within
a Tango Controls system irrespectively to its encoding in a transport protocol or computers' CPU architecture.
It also allows to distinguish different kinds of numeric data, string data, enumerations or multi-values data. 

### Use Cases

There are many use cases for Data Types. Some of them are listed below:

* To specify expected data format for attributes, commands and pipes.

* To display in the same way a numeric value read from a device when some of them are using big-endian encoding and 
  others use little-endian encoding.

* To limit information processed to a practical level by choosing a Data Type of certain precision.
  For example, a value of Data Type DevShort typically provides less precise information and consumes less computing 
  resources than a value of Data Type DevLong.

### DataType

* Any value of Properties, Attributes, Pipes' fields and Commands' input and output arguments SHALL have defined its 
  DataType.
  
* DataType SHALL be as follows: 

```abnf
 DataType = DevVoid 

 DataType =/ DevBoolean 
 
 DataType =/ DevShort / DevLong / DevLong64
 DataType =/ DevUChar / DevUShort / DevULong / DevULong64
 
 DataType =/ DevFloat / DevDouble

 DataType =/ DevString  
 
 DataType =/ DevVarBooleanArray / DevVarDoubleArray / DevVarFloatArray
 DataType =/ DevVarShortArray / DevVarLongArray / DevVarLong64Array / DevVarCharArray
 DataType =/ DevVarStringArray
 DataType =/ DevVarUShortArray / DevVarULongArray / DevVarULong64Array
 
 DataType =/ DevEncoded / DevVarEncodedArray
 
 DataType =/ DevVarLongStringArray / DevVarDoubleStringArray
 
 DataType =/ DevState / DevVarStateArray

 DataType =/ DevEnum
  
 DataType =/ DevPipeBlob
 
 DataTpe =/ DevFailed
``` 



### Numeric

#### DevBoolean

DevBoolean is a data type which values represents logical state of true or false.

* DevBoolean SHALL use the following name:

```abnf
DevBoolean = "DevBoolean"
```

* Values which DataType is DevBoolean SHALL carry one bit of information.

#### Integer data types

DevShort, DevLong, DevLong64 represent signed integer values. DevUChar, DevUShort, DevULong and DevULong64 represent
unsigned values.

* Integer DataType SHALL have the following names:

```abnf
 DevShort = "DevShort"
 DevLong = "DevLong"
 DevLong64 = "DevLong64"
 DevUChar = "DevUChar"
 DevUShort = "DevUShort"
 DevULong = "DevULong"
 DevULong64 = "DevULong64"
```

* Values of integer data types SHALL be in defined ranges and the information they carry SHALL have number of bits
  as specified in the table below:

| DataType | Range | Bits of information |
-----------|-------|---------------------|
| DevShort | -(2^15) to (2^15)-1 |         16 |
| DevLong  | -(2^31) to (2^31)-1 | 32 |
| DevLong64  | -(2^63) to (2^63)-1 | 64 |
| DevUChar | 0 to 255 | 8 |
| DevUShort | 0 to (2^16)-1 | 16 |
| DevULong | 0 to (2^32)-1 | 32 |

```

* Values of DevFloat type SHALL be of IEEE 754 single precision floating-point format and MAY be encoded in 32 bits.
* Values of DevDouble type SHALL be of IEEE 754 double precision floating-point format and MAY be encoded in 64 bits.

#### String data type

DevString values represent strings (sequence of characters).

* DevString SHALL use the following names:

```abnf

#### Structures

Value of the DevEncoded type is a structure to carry binary data with application and context specific meaning. 

* Name of DevEncoded type SHALL be as follows:
```abnf
