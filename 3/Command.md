## Tango Command Specification

 The specification of Command aims to define a standard structure and type to use in any implementation of Tango.

### Goals

 A Command in a Tango Controls represents an action, a sequence or other procedure executed remotely by a Device. The meaning of commands is quite similar to the meaning of methods in object oriented design.

This specification aims to define a Command in order to be able to :
 
 * Execute action considering an argument

 
 * Execute an asynchronous action 

 
 * Expect a reply in any case within a certain timeout

 
 * Be represented by meta data

 

Additionally, Command may be used for:

 * Reading and writing device parameters, as an alternative to read and write Tango Attribute for legacy reason (although Tango Attribute is the prefer way).


### Use Cases

 The use of Command by the developer of Device allows to resolve different situation:

 * A command "Stop" can trigger the ending of a movement for a motor or an integration for a detector
 * A command "Send" can take any SCPI command as argument and wait for the reply
 * A command "Execute" can launch a macro which may take long time to be executed in the background. The reply is just an acknowledgement that the sequence will be executed. The current state of progress can be retrieve by the state of the Tango Device

## Specification

 A Tango Command is a strict definition of a function apply at the Device context:

 * The Command SHALL have a unique identifier, called the Command Name

 * The Command input or output are called Argument

 * The Command SHALL have one input Argument, called ARGIN

 * The Command SHALL have one output Argument, called ARGOUT
 
 An Argument represents the input and output of a Command and its specification can only applied to a Command as below:

 * Argument SHALL have an Argument Type which set the type of the Argument Value

 * Argument MAY have an Argument Description which describe the meaning of the Argument Value
  
 An Argument Value only exists during the phase of execution of a Command. 
 In this case a Command MAY have 2 Arguments Values, one for ARGIN and one for ARGOUT.
 
 The Argument Type, Argument Value, Argument Representation and Argument Description are specified below as litteral representation. This SHOULD NOT constraint the implementation to use a binary format for the transport layer.

``` 
 
Additionally, the Command can be represented by meta data:

 * A Command SHALL have a visibility level for the user called Display Level, which MAY be taken in consideration in the User Interface.

 ```abnf
 display-level = "OPERATOR" | "EXPERT"
 ```

 Note: The description of a command is given by both the description of ARGIN and ARGOUT. There is no Command Description as such.


### Reserved Commands

 Although the user can define any kind of commands, some specific commands are essential to the Tango Device to work properly. 
 The Reserved Command MUST be define as the Command Name, the ARGIN and the ARGOUT as describe below:
 
| Reserved Command | Name | ARGIN | ARGOUT |
|---|---|---|---|
| State Command | "State" | DevVoid| DevState |
| Status Command | "Status" | DevVoid| DevString |
| Init Command | "Init" | DevVoid| DevVoid |

 
### Global Behaviour

 * The Command SHALL always return a result when executed even when the ARGOUT is from the type DevVoid. The only exception is a "Fire and Forget" which force to be executed in one way (flag for asynchronous command execution).

 * The execution of the Command SHALL be unique

 * The execution of the Command SHALL apply only in the context of a Device

### Naming convention
 * The Command Name SHALL use the following convention:

 ``` ABNF
 command-name = 1*VCHAR
 ```
